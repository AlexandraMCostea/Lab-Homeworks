# Lab Homework:
1. AnalogRGBLEDControl: Control the RGB LED with 3 potentiometers. Every potentiometer should be conected to one of the color pins and control them.
2. Knock detector buzzer: The passive buzzer should read a knock. After 5 seconds the active buzzer should start making sounds. When the pushbutton is pressed the active buzzer should stop.
3. 4 Digit 7 Segment Display: Using a joystick you could move between the 4 digits using the Y axis and after choosing one, you could increment it using the X axis.
4. Menu Display: Using a joystick you could choose what to do in the "game". The X axis was used to move between options, the Y axis to enter a submenu or to exit.
