### Final project for Introduction to Robotics Course

## Description
  Useless box is a simple projects, which takes a lot of patience.
  As the name says, it does, well, nothing really. 
  The project is based on the curiosity of the people that see the box.
  I made the box of wood pieces and the arms of some plastic.
  
  P.S. A useless box is more annoying than expected (to build and to play with too), but it's cute.
  P.P.S. The cat loves it too (it's a box tho).

The tutorial is more complex than my project. I excluded the wheels , keeping it simple. 
As for the code, I changed at first the positions of the servomotors to adapt to my "arm". 
After modifying the design a little bit, I returned to the initial ones, because they simply fitted (talking about luck?).
